## The CLVTools Package

Today, customer lifetime value (CLV) is the central metric for valuing
customers. It describes the long-term economic value of customers and
gives managers an idea of how customers will evolve over time. To model
CLVs in continuous non-contractual business settings such as retailers,
probabilistic customer attrition models are the preferred choice in
literature and practice.

The R package `CLVTools` provides an efficient and easy to use
implementation framework for probabilistic customer attrition models in
non-contractual settings. Building up on the learnings of other
implementations, the package adopts S4 classes to allow constructing
rich and rather complex models that nevertheless still are easy to apply
for the end user. The framework is capable to accommodate a variety of
probabilistic customer attrition models for non-contractual settings in
continuous and discrete time.

Currently, CLVTools implements the following probabilistic models:

1)  Standard Pareto/NBD model (Schmittlein, Morrison & Colombo 1987)

2)  Pareto/NBD model with **time-invariant** contextual factors (Fader &
    Hardie 2007)

3)  Pareto/NBD model with **time-varying** contextual factors (Bachmann,
    Meierer & Näf 2020)

4)  Standard BG/NBD model (Fader, Hardie, & Lee 2005)

5)  BG/NBD model with **time-invariant** contextual factors (Fader &
    Hardie 2007)

6)  Standard Gamma/Gompertz/NBD (Bemmaor & Glady 2012)

7)  Gamma/Gompertz/NBD model with **time-invariant** contextual factors
    (Näf, Bachmann & Meierer 2020)

8)  Gamma/Gamma model to estimate customer spending (Colombo & Jiang
    1999; Fader, Hardie & Lee 2005; Fader & Hardie 2013)

In future versions of `CLVTools` the following models are added. See
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bachmannpatrick/CLVTools/projects)
for a time-line.

9)  Standard BG/BB model (Fader, Hardie, & Shang 2010)

In addition the framework features a system of layers between the
optimizer and the log-likelihood function to allow the flexible addition
of model extensions during the model fitting process. Currently these
layers include:

  - Correlation of the purchase and the attrition process

  - L2 regularization for parameters of contextual factors

  - Equality constraints between parameters of contextual factors for
    the purchase and the attrition process.

## Installation

Install the most recent **stable release from CRAN**:

    install.packages("CLVTools")

Install the **development version from GitHub** (using the `devtools`
package):

    devtools::install_github("bachmannpatrick/CLVTools", ref = "development")

To **compile the package from source**, please be advised that
`CLVTools` relies on an external C++ library called `GSL`. This library
has to be installed on your computer to be able to compile `CLVTools`
from source. Follow these 3 steps:

1.  Update to the latest version of R.

2.  Install the external dependency (`GSL`):

<!-- end list -->

  - *For Linux:*
    
        apt-get update
        apt-get install libgsl0-dev
    
    If you are using an R Docker container with Linux
    (e.g. rocker/tidyverse), you can build up on these Docker images as
    follows
    
        FROM rocker/tidyverse
        RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get -y install \
        libgsl0-dev
    
    Alternatively, follow the instruction in the section “Installing
    Dependencies external to the R system” at
    <https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/03-install-packages.html>
    to install `GSL` in a running Docker container with Linux.

  - *For Mac:*
    
        brew install gsl

  - *For Windows:*  
    First, install `RTools` through
    <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/> (\> v4.0). Next,
    use the new `RTools` package manager to install the `GSL` library
    (see
    <https://github.com/r-windows/docs/blob/master/rtools40.md#readme>)
    by using `pacman` through the `RTools Bash`:
    
        pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-gsl

<!-- end list -->

3.  Install the development version from source:

<!-- end list -->

    devtools::install_github("bachmannpatrick/CLVTools", ref = "development")

## A Minimal Example

For detailed instructions and all available options and model variations
see the detailed
[walkthrough](https://www.clvtools.com/articles/CLVTools.html) and the
[manual](https://www.clvtools.com/reference/index.html).

Start by loading the package:

``` r
library("CLVTools")
```

As Input data `CLVTools` requires customers’ transaction history. Every
transaction record consists of a purchase date and customer ID.

``` r
data("apparelTrans")
apparelTrans
#>         Id       Date  Price
#>    1:    1 2005-01-03 230.30
#>    2:   10 2005-01-03  84.39
#>    3:   10 2005-02-25 131.07
#>    4:   10 2005-04-05  86.43
#>    5:  100 2005-01-03  11.49
#>   ---                       
#> 2349: 1221 2006-01-23  26.57
#> 2350: 1221 2006-03-09 129.82
#> 2351: 1221 2006-05-14  14.37
#> 2352: 1222 2005-01-03  44.77
#> 2353: 1222 2005-03-03  99.21
```

Before we estimate a model, we are required to initialize a data object
using the `clvdata()` command. The data object contains the prepared
transactional data and is later used as input for model fitting.
Additionally we specify options for the date and time units, estimation
duration and variable names (see
[Walkthrough](https://www.clvtools.com/articles/CLVTools.html) for
details). Make sure to store the generated object in a variable, e.g. in
our example `clv.apparel`.

``` r
clv.apparel <- clvdata(apparelTrans,  
                       date.format="ymd", 
                       time.unit = "week",
                       estimation.split = 40,
                       name.id = "Id",
                       name.date = "Date",
                       name.price = "Price")
```

Be aware that probabilistic models such as the ones implemented in
CLVTools are usually applied to specific customer cohorts. That means,
you analyze customer that have joined your company at the same time
(usually same day, week, month, or quarter). For more information on
cohort analysis, see also
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis). Consequently, the
data apparelTrans in this example is not the full transaction records of
a fashion retailer, but rather only the customer cohort of 250 customers
purchasing for the first time at this business on the day of 2005-01-03.

As a first probabilistic latent attrition model we estimate the standard
Pareto/NBD model and therefore, use the command `pnbd()` to fit the
model and estimate model parameters. Other models such as the BG/NBD
model (`bgnbd()`) and the GGomp/NBD (`ggomnbd()`) are also available.

``` r
est.pnbd <- pnbd(clv.data = clv.apparel)
#> Starting estimation...
#> Estimation finished!
est.pnbd
#> Pareto NBD Standard Model
#> 
#> Call:
#> pnbd(clv.data = clv.apparel)
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>       r    alpha        s     beta  
#>  0.7866   5.3349   0.3570  11.6152  
#> KKT1: TRUE 
#> KKT2: TRUE 
#> 
#> Used Options:
#> Correlation:     FALSE
```

You can always use `summary()` to get details on CLVTools object (also
before they are estimated):

``` r
#Full detailed summary of the parameter estimates
summary(est.pnbd)
#> Pareto NBD Standard  Model 
#> 
#> Call:
#> pnbd(clv.data = clv.apparel)
#>

```

Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict future
customer behavior on an individual level. To do so, we use `predict()`
on the object with the estimated parameters (i.e. `est.pnbd`). In
general, probabilistic customer attrition model predict three expected
characteristics for every customer:

  - “conditional expected transactions” (CET), which is the number of
    transactions to expect form a customer during the prediction period,
  - “probability of a customer being alive” (PAlive) at the end of the
    estimation period and
  - “discounted expected residual transactions” (DERT) for every
    customer, which is the total number of transactions for the residual
    lifetime of a customer discounted to the end of the estimation
    period.

If spending information was provided when initializing the
clvdata-object, also “customer lifetime value” (CLV) is predicted.

``` r
results <- predict(est.pnbd)
#> Predicting from 2005-10-11 until (incl.) 2006-07-16 (39.86 Weeks).
#> Estimating gg model to predict spending...

`clvdata` objects may be plotted using the `plot()` command. Similar to
`summary()`, the output of `plot()` adapts to the current modeling step.

``` r
plot(est.pnbd)
#> Plotting from 2005-01-03 until 2006-07-16.
```
