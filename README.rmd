## The CLVTools Package

Today, customer lifetime value (CLV) is the central metric for valuing customers. It describes the long-term economic value of customers and gives managers an idea of how customers will evolve over time. To model CLVs in continuous non-contractual business settings such as retailers, probabilistic customer attrition models are the preferred choice in literature and practice. 

The R package **CLVTools** provides an efficient and easy to use implementation framework for probabilistic customer attrition models in non-contractual settings. Building up on the learnings of other implementations, the package adopts S4 classes to allow constructing rich and rather complex models that nevertheless still are easy to apply for the end user.
The framework is capable to accommodate a variety of probabilistic customer attrition models for non-contractual settings in continuous and discrete time.

Currently, CLVTools implements the following probabilistic models:

(1) Standard Pareto/NBD model (Schmittlein, Morrison & Colombo 1987)

(2) Pareto/NBD model with **time-invariant** contextual factors (Fader and Hardie 2007)

(3) Pareto/NBD model with **time-varying** contextual factors (Bachmann & Meierer, forthcoming)

 In addition the framework features an "interlayer system" to allow the flexible addtion of model extensions during the model fitting process. Currently these layers include:

- Correlation of the purchase and the attrition process

- L2 regularization for parameters of contextual factors

- Equality constraints between parameters of contextual for the purchase and the attrition process.



## Installation Instructions
Install the stable version from CRAN:
     
```
install.packages("CLVTools")
```

Install the development version from GitHub:
```
devtools::install_github("CLVTools", ref = "development")
```

Note that the package depends on RcppArmadillo and RcppGSL which will likely require additional setup steps in order to compile and install the CLVTools package from source.
