\title{Calculate Variance-Covariance Matrix for CLV Models fitted with Maximum Likelihood Estimation}
\usage{
\method{vcov}{clv.fitted}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted clv model object}

\item{...}{ignored, for consistency with the generic function.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the estimated covariances between the parameter estimates of the model.
The row and column names correspond to the parameter names given by the \code{coef} method.
}
\description{
Returns the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters of the fitted model object.
The variance-covariance matrix is derived from the Hessian that results from the optimization procedure.
First, the Mooreâ€“Penrose generalized inverse of the Hessian is used to obtain an estimate of the
variance-covariance matrix. If the result is not positive definite, \link[Matrix:nearPD]{nearPD} is used
with standard settings to find the nearest positive definite matrix.

Because some parameters may be transformed for the purpose of restricting their value during
the log-likelihood estimation, it requires that the variance estimates are adapted as well to
be comparable to the reported coefficient estimates. See the references for more details on how this is done.

If multiple estimation methods were used, the Hessian of the last method is used.
