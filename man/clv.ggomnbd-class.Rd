\title{Result of fitting the GGompertz/NBD model without covariates}
\description{
Output from fitting the GGompertz/NBD model on data without covariates. It constitutes the estimation
result and is returned to the user to use it as input to other methods such as to make
predictions or plot the unconditional expectation.

Inherits from \linkS4class{clv.fitted.transactions} in order to execute all steps required for fitting a model
without covariates and it contains an instance of class \linkS4class{clv.model.ggomnbd.no.cov} which
provides the required GGompertz/NBD (no covariates) specific functionalities.
