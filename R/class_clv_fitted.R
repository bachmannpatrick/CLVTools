setOldClass("optimx")


#' Fitted CLV Model without covariates
#'
#'
#' The class stores the transaction data and various optimization outputs and options.
#' It is created already when model fitting is initiated and is then used to perform no covariate specific steps
#' during the estimation process.
#' Created from an existing clv.data and clv.model object (or subclasses thereof).
#'
#' Extends the c to perform steps in the estimation that are specific to static covariates models.
#' Contains additional slots to accommodate the various further optimization options that can be used for covariates models.
#'
#' @slot call Single language of the call used to create the object
#' @slot clv.model Single object of (sub-) class \code{clv.model} that determines model-specific behavior.
#' @slot clv.data Single object of (sub-) class \code{clv.data} that contains the data and temporal information to fit the model to.
#' @slot cbs Single \code{data.table} that is the Customer-By-Sufficiency matrix with information about each customers' recency, frequency, and total time observed.
#' @slot prediction.params.model Numeric vector of the model parameters, set and used solely when predicting. Named after model parameters in original scale and derived from \code{coef()}.
#' @slot estimation.used.correlation Single boolean whether the correlation was estimated.
#' @slot name.prefixed.cor.param.m Single character vector of the internal name used for the correlation parameter during optimization.
#' @slot name.correlation.cor Single character vector of the external name used for the correlation parameter.
#' @slot optimx.estimation.output A single object of class \code{optimx} as returned from method \code{optimx::optimx} after optimizing the log-likelihood fitting the model.
#' @slot optimx.hessian Single matrix that is the hessian extracted from the last row of the optimization output stored in the slot \code{optimx.estimation.output}.
